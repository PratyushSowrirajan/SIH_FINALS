"""
ML Expression Recognition System
=================================

Quick Start:
1. Train model: python train_expressions_ml.py
2. Detect expressions: python detect_expressions_ml.py

Training Instructions:
- Make each expression when prompted (200 samples each)
- Expressions: happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgusted
- Press SPACE to start collecting samples
- Hold expression steady for ~7 seconds per expression
- Total time: ~5 minutes

Detection:
- Detects trained expressions in real-time
- Shows "neutral" if no confident match
- Fullscreen white mesh display
- Press 'Q' to quit

Features:
- ML-based: RandomForest with 200 estimators
- 40+ facial features extracted per frame
- Smoothing for stable predictions
- High FPS (30-60) with low latency
- Confidence scoring

Model Storage:
- Saved to: ml_models/expression_model.pkl
- Includes: trained model, scaler, expressions, accuracy

Requirements:
- opencv-python>=4.8.0
- mediapipe>=0.10.5
- numpy>=1.24.0
- scikit-learn>=1.3.0
